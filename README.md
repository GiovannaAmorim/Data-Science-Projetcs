# Data-Science-Projetcs
Repo with all my collaboration on team projects performed back at the time while pursuing Data Science at CCT College Dublin


## [Project 1](https://github.com/GiovannaAmorim/Data-Science-Projetcs/blob/Project-1---Data-Visualizatiom/GiovannaAmorim%20-%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb)
### [Data Visualization](https://github.com/GiovannaAmorim/Data-Science-Projetcs/blob/Project-1---Data-Visualizatiom/GiovannaAmorim%20-%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb)

The aim of the project was simply to demonstrate and showcase a better view of the dataset, its columns, values and stats outcomes. 
The dataset used is a compositation of observations of board games from Google Play. 


# Project 2 
## Machine Learning models for the stocks market

This project was made in collaboration with more 2 colleagues from my college. 
That was a more robust project which was made late on our course, so the complexity was bigger than the first project I added. 

I took charge of looking for the datasets to work on, the first steps on the data preparation, a couple of data visualizations and the machine learning model: Double Exponential Smoothing. 
Also, I introduced the table with outcomes comparison for all the companies analysed: Google, Apple, Microsoft and Meta.
