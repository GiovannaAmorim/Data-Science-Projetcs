# Data-Science-Projetcs
Repo with all my collaboration on team projects performed back at the time while pursuing Data Science at CCT College Dublin


## Project 1 
### Data Visualization 

The aim of the project was simply to demonstrate and showcase a better view of the dataset, its columns, values and stats outcomes. 
The dataset used is a compositation of observations of board games from Google Play.
