# Data Science Projetcs
Repo with all my collaboration on team projects performed back at the time while pursuing Data Science at CCT College Dublin




## [Project 1](https://github.com/GiovannaAmorim/Data-Science-Projetcs/blob/Project-1---Data-Visualizatiom/Project%201%20-%20%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb)
### [Data Visualization](https://github.com/GiovannaAmorim/Data-Science-Projetcs/blob/Project-1---Data-Visualizatiom/Project%201%20-%20%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb)

The aim of the project was simply to demonstrate and showcase a better view of the dataset, its columns, values and stats outcomes. 
The dataset used is a composition of observations of board games from Google Play. 




## [Project 2](https://github.com/GiovannaAmorim/Data-Science-Projetcs/blob/Project-2---Machine-Learning-models-for-stocks-market/Project%202%20-%20ML_FINANCE_STOCKS_MARKET.ipynb) 
### [Machine Learning models for the stock market](https://github.com/GiovannaAmorim/Data-Science-Projetcs/blob/Project-2---Machine-Learning-models-for-stocks-market/Project%202%20-%20ML_FINANCE_STOCKS_MARKET.ipynb)

I collaborated with two fellow students from my college on a project that was more complex than our previous one, as it was completed late in our course. My responsibilities included searching for suitable datasets, carrying out the initial data preparation, creating a few data visualizations, and developing the machine learning model using Double Exponential Smoothing. 
Additionally, I presented a comparison table of the results for the analyzed companies - Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta.




## [Project 3](https://github.com/GiovannaAmorim/Data-Science-Projetcs/blob/Project-3---Flight-delay-forecast/Project%203%20-%20Flight%20delay%20forecast.ipynb)
### [Flight delay forecast](https://github.com/GiovannaAmorim/Data-Science-Projetcs/blob/Project-3---Flight-delay-forecast/Project%203%20-%20Flight%20delay%20forecast.ipynb)

Another project worked with my colleagues. The goal is to predict flight delays and measure the accuracy of our models. 
I built up the Machine Learning models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, using cross-validation and grid-search to optimize the hyperparameter settings for the binary issue we were working on. 
In addition, I collaborated on data cleaning procedures to ensure accurate results.
