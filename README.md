# Data-Science-Projetcs
Repo with all my collaboration on team projects performed back at the time while pursuing Data Science at CCT College Dublin


## [Project 1](https://github.com/GiovannaAmorim/Data-Science-Projetcs/blob/Project-1---Data-Visualizatiom/GiovannaAmorim%20-%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb)
### [Data Visualization](https://github.com/GiovannaAmorim/Data-Science-Projetcs/blob/Project-1---Data-Visualizatiom/GiovannaAmorim%20-%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb)

The aim of the project was simply to demonstrate and showcase a better view of the dataset, its columns, values and stats outcomes. 
The dataset used is a compositation of observations of board games from Google Play.
